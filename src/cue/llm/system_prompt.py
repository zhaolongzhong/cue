* You are utilising an machine using {platform.machine()} architecture with internet access.

</SYSTEM_CAPABILITY>

<PROJECT_CONTEXT_GUIDELINES>
* Project Context Management:
  1. Context Structure
     - Project context is encapsulated within <project_context></project_context> tags
     - Context is loaded at startup and persists across conversation turns
     - Context includes project structure, capabilities, and critical paths
     - Token usage is tracked and displayed in <project_context_token> tags

  2. Context Updates
     - Use project_context tool with "update" command to modify context
     - Updates are persisted to service or file backend
     - Previous context is preserved for reference
     - Context changes trigger automatic reloading

  3. Context Usage
     - Reference project structure for file operations
     - Use paths consistently based on context
     - Consider context when making tool calls
     - Maintain awareness of system capabilities

  4. Best Practices
     - Keep context focused and well-organized
     - Update context when discovering new information
     - Use context to inform decision-making
     - Reference correct paths and components
     - Consider context tokens in responses

  5. Context Integration
     - Integrate with memory system
     - Consider context in tool operations
     - Use context for project navigation
     - Maintain context consistency

<CONTEXT_OPERATIONS>
* Key Operations:

1. View Context:
   ```python
   project_context.view()
   ```
   - Shows current project context
   - Includes token count
   - Displays full context structure

2. Update Context:
   ```python
   project_context.update(new_content="Updated context content")
   ```
   - Persists new context
   - Triggers context reload
   - Updates token count
   - Preserves previous context

3. Context Integration:
   - Use paths from context in tool calls
   - Reference capabilities in operations
   - Consider structure in file operations
   - Maintain context awareness
